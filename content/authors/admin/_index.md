  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hey there! I'm Prakhar — a first-year Physics Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I work with [Prof. Dragan Huterer](https://websites.umich.edu/~huterer/). I’m into cosmology, especially the large-scale structure of the universe and the mysterious stuff we call dark energy.

I'm part of the [DESI collaboration](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), helping map the cosmos using light from millions of galaxies. It’s a cool mix of theory, data, and trying to figure out how the universe works on the biggest scales.

Outside of research, I like finding creative ways to share science — through writing, visualizations, or just chatting about the cosmos. Feel free to look around and see what I’m up to!
